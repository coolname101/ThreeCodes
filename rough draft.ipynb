    "Python is the most used programming language. Used by over 80% of data scientist. As for programming, programming is simply how to solve real life problems using algorithms. Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language, which unlike its counterparts, it is an interpreted language and not a compiled onethus making it rather easy to learn and deploy. We are here to showcase how convenient python is and the relative easiness to learn it by showing our progress from the past few weeks of dealing with python."
